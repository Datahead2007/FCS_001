RC Flight Control System:

Misc. Processing and Arduino applications I've created for a open source prototype of a ground based control
platform for my RC airplanes.

PROJECT GOALS: To produce a fully functional flight control system for my RC model airplanes.

The project will includes schematics, sketches and libraries needed to create a fully functional flight control
system with Altitude indicator, Altimeter, Compass and heading gages along with a in flight real time video feed
with GPS. The remote hardware for the aircraft is an Arduino based platform communicating to a PC via a RF feed.
Where as the main computer or base station will use Processing to display the flight information to the user.
Also sending control data back to the remote unit to fly the aircraft.

Disclaimer:

  To the best of my knowledge all software here is open source and fall under GPU license. I will do my best to
mention the author if possible and supply links to websites where the software was obtained.
  Please be aware RC aircraft are dangerous when used improperly. This project is strictly in its Alpha stage
and I in no way shape or form responsible for injury or damage to ones self, spectators, Aircraft, or property

Thanks for looking at my project. All code written here by me may be freely distributed and modified as Open Source.
