RC_Test_Plateform
=================

  Misc. Processing and Arduino applications I've created for a open source prototype of aground based control
plateform for my RC airplanes.

  The project will includes scematics, sketchs and libraries needed to create a fully fuctional flight contol system
with Atitude indicator, Altimeter, Compass and heading gages alonn with a in flight real time video feed with GPS.

  The remote hardware for the aircraft is an Arduino based plateform communicating to a PC via a RF feed. Where as
the main computer or base station will use Processing to display the flight information to the user. Also sending
control data back to the remote unit to fly the aircraft.

  Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge all software here is open source.
