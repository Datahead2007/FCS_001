RC Flight Control System:

  Misc. Processing and Arduino applications I've created for a open source prototype of a ground based control
plateform for my RC airplanes. Please be aware RC aircraft are dangerios when used inproperly. This project is
strickly in it's Alpha stage and I in no way shape or form responsible for injury or damage to ones self,
spectators, Aircraft, or property when using any of the information, hardware or software discribed or listed
here in this redepository.

PROJECT GOALS: To produde a fully fuctional flight control system for my RC model airplanes.

  The project will includes scematics, sketchs and libraries needed to create a fully fuctional flight contol system
with Atitude indicator, Altimeter, Compass and heading gages along with a in flight real time video feed with GPS.

  The remote hardware for the aircraft is an Arduino based plateform communicating to a PC via a RF feed. Where as
the main computer or base station will use Processing to display the flight information to the user. Also sending
control data back to the remote unit to fly the aircraft.

  Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge all software here is open source and fall under GPL licence. I will do my
best to mention the author if possible and suppy links to web stes where the software was obtained.

Thanks for looking at my project. All code written here by me may be freely distubruted and modified as Open Source.
